## Web application with react, redux, redux-saga and a lot of interesting tools :rocket:

To execute, just clone this project and execute the following commands on your terminal <br />

We're using json-server to simulate one fake API, so we need to install it globally.

> npm install -g json-server

<br />Now we'll install our project dependencies.

> yarn install

<br />After everething installed, we can start our fake API. If you want to test the application with some delay, just add -d 2000 to the folow command to add 2 seconds each API response.

> json-server server.json -p 3333

<br />And let's start our application too

> yarn start

<br />Just open your browser on this url: http://localhost:3000
